# Student_Accommodation


The current system of accommodation application is not yet computerized and this has made the process of application to be very slow and tiresome. During application, forms are provided to students who fill them by hand and deposit them to the Residence Office. The staff in charge classifies all the application forms and processes each case at time.

The Student Accommodation System is introduced as a computerized system to ease the pressure on students and administrators. The new residence application system will help to eliminate the paper-based applications thereby speeding up processing as details will be captured in the database. This will help to eliminate the delays caused by the sequential checking of each accommodation for the availability of rooms. The system will check automatically for the available rooms to help accelerate the room allocation process thus making it painless for the managers to allocate rooms to students.
